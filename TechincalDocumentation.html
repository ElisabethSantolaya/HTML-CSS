      <p>The JavaScript programming language, developed by Netscape, Inc., is not part of the Java platform. JavaScript does not create applets or stand-alone applications. In its most common form, JavaScript resides inside HTML documents, and can provide levels of interactivity to web pages that are not achievable with simple HTML.</p>
      <p>Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language, Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only, Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text, they require different plug-ins.</p>
      <code>JavaScript code: 
        <pre>
            &lt;html&gt;

      <ul>Differences between JavaScript and Java:
        <li>Java is a pure object-oriented programming language while JavaScript is prototype-based, though it has the ability to emulate object-oriented programming.</li>
        <li>Java es un lenguaje compilado y JavaScript interpretado.</li>

      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>

      <ul>What is CSS for?
        <li>Present the final document in different styles (screen, voice, print);</li>
        <li>work with standards and separate (to some extent) the structure of the presentation, achieving a more defined work;</li>

      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
      <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
      <code>
        <pre>
            num = int(input('Introduzca un numero: '))
            ifnum % 2 == 0:
                print('Par')
            else:
                print('Impar')

Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it, use it as well as share it. </li>
        <li>Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days.

      <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
      <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</p>

      <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.</p>
      <p>Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, Java and Lisp.</p>
